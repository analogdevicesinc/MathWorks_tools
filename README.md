As with many open source packages, we use [GitHub](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools) to do develop and maintain the source, and [GitLab](https://GitLab.com/) for continuous integration.
  - If you want to just use MathWorks_tools, we suggest using the [latest release](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools/releases/latest).
  - If you think you have found a bug in the release, or need a feature which isn't in the release, try the latest **untested** builds from the master branch.

If you use it, and like it - please let us know. If you use it, and hate it - please let us know that too.

## Supported Tools and Releases

We provide support across two releases of MATLAB. This does not mean older releases will not work but they are not maintained. Currently supported tools are:
- Bug fixes only: MATLAB R2018b with Vivado 2017.4
- Bug fixes and new features: MATLAB R2019a with Vivado 2018.2

## Support and Documentation

All support questions should be posted in our [EngineerZone](https://ez.analog.com/linux-device-drivers/linux-software-drivers) forums. Documentation is included within the toolbox but additional documentation is avaible on the [ADI Wiki](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/eval/user-guides/matlab_bsp).

## Building & Installing

If you don't want to use the toolbox installers you can manually build the BSP. Should be a quick matter of `make build`:

```
rgetz@pinky:~/MathWorks_tools$ make -C CI/scripts/ build 
```

Then simply add the `hdl_wa_bsp` folder to your MATLAB path `addpath(genpath('hdl_wa_bsp'))`
